## Synopsis:
A little project ive started to keep my C++ skills and DirectX skills sharp as well as test out some new techniques.

I started the project shortly after my Real-Time Graphics hand-in some time in January 2017.

## Motivation: 
The original project was done when i was fairly new to Graphics API's and wasnt the greatest C++ programmer.This project is something to allow me to continue learning and improving my C++ and DirectX Skills and possibly allow for more expansion as well as having some fun with real-time rendering.
